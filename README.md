# CHIPR
CHIPR PES: Optimized toolbox for fitting potential energy surface

A general program to fit global potential energy surfaces of ABC, AB2, and A3 triatomic molecules to ab initio points is reported. It is based on the Combined-Hyperbolic-Inverse-Power-Representation (CHIPR) method. The final form describes all dissociating fragments, long-range and valence interactions, while warranting the system permutational symmetry. The code yields as output a Fortran 90 subroutine that readily evaluates the potential and gradient at any arbitrary geometry.
